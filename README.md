# Teacher's Aide Mock Start-up landing page

*Responsive landing page for a mock start-up, styled with Bootstrap. Deployed [here](https://eireann07.github.io/teachers-aide-mock-startup/) with Github pages. Uses original graphics. Wireframed with Balsamiq.*

**What I enjoyed while building this app:** The design! I spend so much time styling the page, making sure images were correctly places in order to be effective, and creating images to make sure the page felt authentic. 

**What I struggled with while building this app:** Styling the iPad in the page head! Rotating and scaling it correctly took way more time than I was anticipating, but I'm happy with the outcome. 

**Things I learned through building this app:** There is so much that just goes into making a website look professional, authentic, and credible. Responsiveness is also key...if a page or app looks good on a browser, but does not look good on a tablet or mobile interface, that can be a huge turn-off for customers or users.
